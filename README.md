# Sentiment-Analyzer

A sentiment classifier tool for the drug reviews given by patients.
Used the GloVe vector word model for the numbered wordVectors and wordLists.
This is my first try on doing Tensorflow projects on Deep Learning. So I am open to all kinds of feedback.

Make sure you download the data before running the code.

Thanks to Oreilly, which motivated me to hardcode LSTMs on this project.
Credits to them.
